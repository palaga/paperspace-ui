* Reverse Proxy

To keep access for all installations the same, I use a proper reverse
proxy to do authentication and forwarding to the right backed.

This notebook will setup HAProxy, so it can be used over the
tensorboard URL, provided by paperspace. First, configure username and
password in =comfyui_haproxy.cfg=. Then run the following block to get
the URL and start HAProxy:

#+begin_src jupyter-python
!echo https://tensorboard-$PAPERSPACE_FQDN
!haproxy -V -f /notebooks/haproxy.cfg
#+end_src
